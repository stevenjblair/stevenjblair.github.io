Hi! I'm Steven Blair ðŸ‘‹.  I am a computational researcher in Massachusetts with a love for all things science. I enjoy coding, talking to people about axolotls, hobby farming, diesel engines, Italian food, and my three black cats.  I will transform this site into a blog of my bioinformatics notebooks, as well as other code I have created, not only to share the information with anyone who wants it, but to also showcase my expertise.  I will likely end up talking about mushrooms, axolotls, and bamboo along the way.

My previous experience includes five years in a molecular biology lab studying limb and organ regeneration in axolotls.  [You can read the preprint here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.29.474455v3).  I have a lot of experience with next generation sequencing analysis including bulk, single cell, and ATAC-seq.  Using a lot of tools along the way.  I am fluent in several computer languages (and two human ones), I have used machine learning and computer vision, AI, NGS, data visualization, data management, and a whole bunch of different containerization methods, HPC, and cloud computing platforms.  My plan is to share all of the code I have created over the years with an in depth explanation of each function call, parameter, and argument.  I will also compile a database of the best sources i have found along the way.  Over the next few weeks I will be transforming this site into a picture of the world of bioinformatics and its methods, and most likely my other interests as well.

## Projects

### Current Project: Covalent Binding of Thioredoxin to TXNIP is Required for Diet-induced Insulin Resistance 1 in the Liver

Currently the project is in review and once published I will make the code available.
